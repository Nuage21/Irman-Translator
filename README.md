If you are working on the code then it would be easier if you set up a python test project that contains the code you're working on, by that ou won't have to restart the server.

Finally to test the whole project then you got to start the localhost server: `$ python manage.py runserver`, then  go to your browser and enter to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/translator`
